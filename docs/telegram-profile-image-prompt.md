# Ask UAE Telegram Bot - Profile Image Generation Prompt

## Platform Identity

**Ask UAE** (@askuae_bot) is an AI-powered UAE market intelligence platform built for Korean investors. It provides real-time answers about the UAE market — politics, economy, sovereign wealth funds (ADIA, Mubadala, ADQ, MGX), K-wave opportunities, business setup, and investment landscape — through a bilingual (Korean/English) conversational interface.

The name "Ask" conveys approachability and interactivity: users don't passively read reports, they **ask questions and get immediate, expert-level answers** backed by RAG retrieval, live web search, and curated reference data. "UAE" anchors the geographic expertise — this is not a generic Middle East tool but a laser-focused UAE specialist.

## What the Bot Does

- Answers any UAE-related question in Korean or English
- Covers 10+ sectors: finance, energy, AI/tech, defense, tourism, e-commerce, real estate, healthcare, logistics, crypto
- Tracks Korea-UAE business relations and K-wave (K-beauty, K-pop, K-food) opportunities in the Gulf
- Maps UAE power structures (7 Emirates, ruling families, SWFs)
- Validates facts and cites sources

## Target Audience

Korean fund managers, venture capitalists, corporate strategists, K-beauty brand operators, and business development professionals exploring UAE market entry or investment opportunities. These are serious professionals making capital allocation decisions.

## Brand Personality

- **Authoritative yet approachable** — expert knowledge delivered conversationally
- **Precise and data-driven** — supports investment decisions, not casual chat
- **Bilingual bridge** — connects Korean business culture with UAE market reality
- **Modern intelligence tool** — not a traditional report, but an always-on AI analyst

## Visual Direction for Profile Image

### Core Concept
The image should convey: **"Your AI-powered gateway to UAE market intelligence"** — a fusion of UAE identity and modern AI/data intelligence, with a subtle Korean connection.

### Color Palette
- **Primary:** UAE flag colors — Red (#CE1126), Green (#009639), White, Black
- **Accent:** Gold (#C5A572) — representing wealth, sovereign funds, and Gulf luxury
- **Background:** Deep navy or dark charcoal (#1A1A2E or #0F0F23) — professional, data-dashboard aesthetic
- **Highlight:** Electric blue or teal (#00D4AA or #3B82F6) — AI/tech modernity

### Symbolic Elements to Consider
- **UAE visual anchors:** Stylized falcon silhouette (national symbol), 7-pointed star (7 Emirates), desert-to-skyline motif (tradition meets modernity), geometric Islamic patterns
- **Intelligence/AI markers:** Neural network nodes, data flow lines, subtle circuit patterns, glowing connections
- **The "Ask" concept:** Speech bubble or query icon integrated into the design — reinforcing the interactive Q&A nature
- **Typography:** "Ask UAE" text — clean, modern sans-serif. "Ask" can be visually emphasized or stylized differently from "UAE"

### Style Guidelines
- **NOT a cartoon or mascot** — this is a professional investment tool
- **NOT overly ornate** — clean and modern, not traditional Arabic calligraphy style
- **Circular crop-friendly** — Telegram profile images are displayed as circles, so the design must work within a circular frame
- **Readable at small sizes** — Telegram shows profile images as small as 30-40px thumbnails in chat lists
- **High contrast** — must be instantly recognizable in both light and dark Telegram themes

### Composition Suggestions

**Option A: Iconic Mark**
A stylized falcon head composed of geometric/circuit-pattern lines, with "Ask UAE" text below or integrated. Gold and teal on dark background.

**Option B: Typographic**
Bold "Ask UAE" typography with the UAE flag colors subtly integrated (red-green-white-black gradient or stripe accent). Minimal, text-forward design with a small AI/data motif.

**Option C: Shield/Emblem**
A modern shield or badge shape (referencing UAE coat of arms) containing abstract data visualization elements (nodes, connections) with "Ask UAE" text. Professional and authoritative.

**Option D: Globe/Gateway**
A stylized globe or portal focused on the Arabian Peninsula region, with glowing data connections radiating outward. Suggests "gateway to UAE intelligence." Korean flag element subtly placed as one of the connection endpoints.

### Technical Requirements
- **Format:** PNG with transparency, or solid background
- **Resolution:** At least 512x512px (Telegram recommended)
- **Shape consideration:** Must look good cropped to a circle
- **File size:** Under 5MB (Telegram limit)
